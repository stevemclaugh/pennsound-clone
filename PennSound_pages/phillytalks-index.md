Series Background**

"PhillyTalks" is a dialogue with contemporary poets, begun in 1997. Its newsletter features a written exchange between
two poets, each to the other's poetry and context, and is available [online](http://slought.org/series/PhillyTalks/) at
least one week prior to the event. PhillyTalks, the event, presents both a reading by the poets and a discussion that extends
the newsletter conversation. Frequently, the event is webcast live to include the participation of poets elsewhere.
The series was curated by Louis Cabri and, through most of its run, was produced and managed online by Aaron Levy.
