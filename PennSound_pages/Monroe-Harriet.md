The W. Cabell Greet Recordings: Reading at Columbia University on January 29, 1932
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[![](images/Harriet_Monroe_1920.jpg)](images/Lindsay/aluminum-platter-large.jpg)

These recordings were recorded by Barnard professor W. Cabell Greet, a lexicologist and scholar of American dialects. For more information see [Mustazza on *The Contemporary Poets Series*](https://jacket2.org/article/provenance-report) in *Jacket2*.  
  
PennSound wishes to thank the staff at Columbia's Rare Book & Manuscript Library, especially Thai Jones, Jennifer Lee, and Karla Nielsen, for helping us to make these recordings available.  
  
*Editor's note: The recordings here were originally made on aluminum platters. They were subsequently dubbed to reel-to-reel tapes by the Library of Congress in the 1970s. These digitizations are made from the reels, which are stored at Columbia University. --Chris Mustazza, University of Pennsylvania*

**Notes**

1.  [Note 1:](#travel-ref) Monroe states that she will read three poems of western travel, but only two poems exist in the recordings. It is unclear if the third was lost before the record was converted to reel-to-reel or if it was never recorded.
