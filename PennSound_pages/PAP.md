Even if you were watching the innovation called cable TV in 1977 and 1978, what are the chances that you saw a show titled *Public Access Poetry*? Produced by [Poetry Project](http://poetryproject.org/) stalwarts Greg Masters, Gary Lenhart, David Herz, Didi Susan Dubelyew, Daniel Krakauer, Bob Rosenthal and Rochelle Kraut, PAP programs featured half-hour readings by a wide range of poets and performers who could roughly be categorized as “downtown,” more often than not linked in one way or another with the [Poetry Project](http://poetryproject.org/). The cable TV series lasted two seasons (one live, the other recorded for later airing) and was produced with little-to-no broadcasting experience by the PAP personnel.

Forty-six fragile open-reel videotapes of these shows were preserved and, in 2009, were donated to the [Poetry Project](http://poetryproject.org/) by the PAP team. A grant and subsequent anonymous support supported the preservation and digitization of 31 of the original tapes.

In April 2011, The [Poetry Project](http://poetryproject.org/), in collaboration with [Anthology Film Archives](http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/), presented a two-program screening series at Anthology – one featured highlights from various episodes of *Public Access Poetry* and another showed three full episodes.

The [Poetry Project](http://poetryproject.org/), dedicated to making the *Public Access Poetry* archive available to the public, as envisioned by its producers more than 30 years ago, is happy to be collaborating with PennSound to accomplish this.

*Funding to preserve* Public Access Poetry *was made possible through a Consulting Fund re-grant from the [New York State Literary Presenters Technical Assistance Program (LitTAP)](http://www.littap.org/). LitTAP is made possible with public funds from the [New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA)](http://www.nysca.org/public/home.cfm), a State agency, and administered through [Just Buffalo Literary Center](http://www.justbuffalo.org/). Additional funding was made possible through the generosity of two anonymous donors. All videos transferred by [The Standby Program](http://www.standby.org/standby/) at [MercerMedia](http://www.mercermedia.com/) with consulting support from [Anthology Film Archives](http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/).*
