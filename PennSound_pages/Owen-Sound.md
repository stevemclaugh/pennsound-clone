Owen Sound
==========

![](http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/misc/Images/Owen-Sound.png)

Owen Sound, the sound-performance poetry ensemble, began its life inspired by watching and hearing [The Four Horsemen](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/4-Horsemen.html).

In 1974 Michael Dean, David Penhale, Steven Smith (now Steven Ross Smith) and Richard Truhlar began workshopping ensemble sound poetry explorations in a Toronto framing studio on Dupont Street operated by poet and framer Brian Dedora.
Dedora was initially involved in these explorations. Before the group had a name, the workshopping led to the collaborative composition of pieces suitable for performance, and in 1976 the quartet,
now calling itself OWEN SOUND \[sometimes O(we)n So(u)nd\], began performing publicly at an event at Fat Alberts Coffee House in Toronto, Ontario.

Over the next four years, they performed as a four-person group but also included solo and duo works in their repertoire.
Their work as a quartet reached a peak in 1978 at the 11th International Festival of Sound Poetry in Toronto (hear live recordings ["Stories & Music For Children"](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Owen-Sound.php#Stories),
["Kinderspielgesange"](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Owen-Sound.php#Kinderspielgesange) and ["1' 54" To..."](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Owen-Sound.php#1-54-To)), which included performances by The Horsemen, jgjgjg, Dick Higgins, and Bernard Heidsieck.

After that Dean, Smith, and Truhlar continued under the Owen Sound name, again performing in solo, duo and trio configurations, until 1985.
Smith and Truhlar often performed together until 1986, but not under the Owen Sound name.

Over their nine years together, Owen Sound presented their works in over 30 performances, including events in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver,
Amsterdam (Stedelijk Museum), London, UK (Canada House and the National Poetry Centre), and even in Owen Sound, Ontario. Along the way, they collaborated with jazz musicians
and other artists including composer Susan Frykberg, performers [The Four Horsemen](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/4-Horsemen.html), and poet Sean O'Huigin. Owen Sound’s final performance, featuring Dean, Smith and Truhlar, occurred at Ultimatum: The Montreal Urban Poetry Festival (see the [original event programme](http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/groups/Owen-Sound/Ultimatum-85-Programme_Montreal.pdf),
courtesy of producer Alan Lord) at the Foufounes Électriques in May 1985, following [bpNichol](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Nichol.php) and [Steve McCaffery](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/McCaffery.php).
