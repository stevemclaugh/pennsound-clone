[Charles Reznikoff](Reznikoff.html) reads from *Holocaust*, New York City, December 21, 1975
============================================================================================

recorded by filmmaker [Abraham Ravett](http://faculty.hampshire.edu/aravett/pages/home.html)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The audio recording and accompanying photographs were made on December 21, 1975 in Charles Reznikoff's NYC apartment. I had just graduated from the Massachusetts College of Art and was working on my first, autobiographical, diary film, *Thirty Years Later*, completed in 1978.

-   Published in 1975 by Black Sparrow Press, *Holocaust* profoundly resonated with me during the process of gathering material for the above-mentioned film project. Without a pre-conceived idea as to how I would shape the film, my hope was that Mr. Reznikoff's reading could be part of the sound track.

-   Mr. Reznikoff's West End apartment was located within a high-rise apartment complex reminiscent of where I grew up during my teens in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, N.Y. He was very kind and gracious to a rather nervous young filmmaker fumbling with his Nagra tape recorder and Sennheiser microphone who hoped that everything would work as planned.

-   Subsequent to the above session, I received permission from Black Sparrow Press as well as from Mr. Reznikoff to include the reading in the film project.

-   I've held on to this audio recording for many years with the thought of producing a cd that could be made available to the public. Through protracted negotiations with Black Sparrow Press, David R. Godine the current publisher of *Holocaust* and most recently, with the Reznikoff estate, I was given permission to make this recording available for non-commercial, educational purposes only.

-   The b/w photographs were made with a medium format, Minolta Autocord camera. The blue toned, 35mm slides were the result of using tungsten rated film during daylight. The combined images record a momentary interaction between this writer and a great poet who was to pass away just a few months later.
