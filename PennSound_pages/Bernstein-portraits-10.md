**Peter Gizzi**  
We were on the roof of the Clocktower, just about to go to the
Chinatown for lunch. On a clear day you can Queens, which is
just over Peter's left shoulder.

[**Cecilia: Dancing the Lines**]()

[Get the Flash Player](http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer) to see this player.

**Cecilia Vicuña**  
Cecilia came to the last poem of
her Kelly Writers House reading. She weaves and unweaves the
strands of the poetics of the Americas, redrawing the borders
of our poetics with the string-like lines of her words, making
imaginary fabrics in which we are embraced.

Tom, Maggie O'Sullivan and I had spent the day walking around
London & Tom pointed out the place his father worked and also
the place where he had one of his first jobs. When Tom was young,
during the Blitz, the city was blacked out at night. But Tom
remermbered a night, at the end of the war, when crowds
gathered in the streets and the lights went on. 1945.
