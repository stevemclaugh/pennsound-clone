The Speech Lab Recordings: Readings at Columbia University, January 16, 1934 and March 10, 1934
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](images/Edgar_Lee_Masters.png)

These recordings were made during two recording sessions at Columbia University, on January 16, 1934 and March 10, 1934, recorded by Barnard professors George W. Hibbitt and W. Cabell Greet, lexicologists and scholars of American dialects. For more information see [Mustazza on *The Contemporary Poets Series*](https://jacket2.org/article/provenance-report) in *Jacket2* and the [Speech Lab Recordings series page](Speech-Lab-Recordings.php).  
  
PennSound wishes to thank the staff at Columbia's Rare Book & Manuscript Library, especially Thai Jones, Jennifer Lee, Devon Maeve Nevola, Jane Siegel, and Karla Nielsen, for helping us to make these recordings available.  
  
These recordings are made available thanks to permission from Hilary Masters and the Edgar Lee Masters estate.  
  
*Editor's note: The recordings here were originally made on aluminum platters. They were subsequently dubbed to reel-to-reel tapes by the Library of Congress in 1978. These digitizations are made from the reels, which are stored at Columbia University. I made the decision to present the recordings in the order in which Columbia
numbered the aluminum platters, except for where I reordered the sequence to keep parts of the same collection together. Sequence numbers, as well as record numbers, are available in the file names. --Chris Mustazza, University of Pennsylvania*
