Basil King is a painter/poet, born in England before WWII and living in Brooklyn since 1968. He attended Black Mountain
College as a teenager and completed apprenticeship as an abstract expressionist in
San Francisco and New York. For the past three decades he has taken his art "from the abstract to
the figure, from the figure to the abstract." His books include *Mirage: a poem in 22 sections*, *Warp spasm*, *Identity*,
*77 Beasts/ Basil King's Beastiary*, *Talisman\#36/37*, and *In the Field Where Daffodils Grow, Short Stories*.
