**NOTE:** The eleven high-school students (all juniors) were nearing the end of a one-trimester seminar on poetry at the
[Friends' Central School](http://www.friendscentral.org/default.aspx) near Philadelphia, taught by Liza Ewen. They visited the
[Kelly Writers House](http://writing.upenn.edu/wh/) on May 12, 2009, and spent the morning meeting with these six poets.
The poets were asked by [Al Filreis](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Filreis.html) to choose just one short poem--a poem that would
somehow convey something significant about themselves as a poet--and to teach that poem in 20 minutes. PennSound is grateful to Ms. Ewen and to Friends' Central School
for participating in this project, and to the Kelly Writers House for hosting it.
