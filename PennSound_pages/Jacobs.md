A note from Ken Jacobs:

*Charles,*

It was 1954 when I returned from military servitude. No later than 57 when I began SSTD. Busting with fury at the big con job we tolerate. Somehow I scrambled the dates on your show, possibly because mention of the Fifties seemed altogether absurd. Anyway, thanks for the opportunity to say some of this. I wish I would've picked up more on the ideas you were introducing but when one is on a trajectory it can be hard to veer off. '61 I was already with Flo, on Easy Street. A mere 5 years later I'd even earn a living, modest ($3500 a year) but we ate.

—Ken
