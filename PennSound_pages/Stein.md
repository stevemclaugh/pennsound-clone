### The Speech Lab Recordings, recorded on January 30, 1935 at Columbia University

[<img src="/static/images/Stein/Stein-Record-sm.jpg" style="width:50.0%" style="height:50.0%" />](images/Stein/Stein-Record.JPG)

Collection editor: Chris Mustazza

These recordings of Stein were made by Columbia Professor of English and Comparative Literature George W. Hibbitt for a record produced by the National Council of Teachers of English, to be distributed to schools on a subscription basis. This series is known as
*The Contemporary Poets Series*, which was started with the recording of [Vachel Lindsay](Lindsay.php) by Hibbitt's colleague W. Cabell Greet in 1931. For more information
on the series, see my essay ["Provenance Report"](https://jacket2.org/article/provenance-report). The recordings below this collection, from Caedmon record TC 1050, originate from these recordings.  
  
The original recordings were made on aluminum records
and were subsequently dubbed to reel-to-reel tapes by the Library of Congress. These digitizations are made from the reels, which are stored at Columbia University. --Chris Mustazza, University of Pennsylvania  
  
PennSound wishes to thank the staff at Columbia's Rare Book & Manuscript Library, especially Thai Jones, Jennifer Lee, Karla Nielsen, and Jane Siegel, for helping us to make these recordings available.

Paris, early 1911

**Madame Recamier. An Opera.**  
Written in Biligmin, September 1930. Only a very short excerpt of this long text is included in the record. perhaps for lack of (recording) space. It's unfortunate, for this short excerpt in no way represents the libretto.

[How She Bowed To Her Brother (2:18)](http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Stein/Stein-Gertrude_She-Bowed-to-Her-Brother.MP3)

[**Interview 1934 (1:19)**](http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Stein/Stein-Gertrude_Interview_1934.mp3)**.**  
Probably the Interview at the Algonquin Hotel, November 1934, upon Stein's arrival.
