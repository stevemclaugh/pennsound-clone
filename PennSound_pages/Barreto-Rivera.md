Untitled Poem
-------------

If you're making a sound that already has meaning,

you take away as much meaning as you can.

If you're making a sound that has very little meaning,

you give it as much meaning as you can.

Think of a horse guiding a camel.

Think of a camel astride which

the human voice is riding.

The voice is yours.

The camel belongs to someone else...

En Esperanto Espero
-------------------

### (for Barrie)

If a, then a.

If a then a, then a again.

If a then a then a again, then a again

and a again, and a again

without encountering b

in this short journey.

B does arise in time,

out of a wish or need for b, denying

other elements.

For a time, that is, until

the literature of c asserts itself

in this small library, reminding one of a

before a was engendered.

If a, then a:

no more than a, no less than a

not equal to

nor larger than

than a.

If a, then a , and a.

B does not change this,

except that it comes later,

like a burst of rain.
