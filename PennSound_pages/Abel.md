David Abel with Lisa Radon, Nico Vassilakis, and James Yeary - "Reading Hazard" (45:00):
[MP3](https://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/groups/textsound/16/Abel-David--Lisa-Radon--Nico-Vassilakis--James-Yeary_01_Reading-Hazard_Textsound_Issue-16_May-2013.mp3)

"Reading Hazard" documents a “linguistic sculpture” devised by David Abel in response to
Avantika Bawa’s installation "At Owners Risk," on view at Suyama Space, Seattle, in June of
2012.
The performance took the form of a simultaneous reading by four poets spatially distributed
within the installation, and was captured by composer and sound artist Steve Peters, who in his
peripatetic recording acted as a fifth performer and the agent of this particular
realization.
