Q.E.D.
------

Q.E.D. was a series of three conversations about queer art and literature that took place in Summer 2012.

Each of the three events brought together an artist, a writer, and a critic. The first event, "Thing Unsaid," took place on April 11, 2012 and featured Melissa Buzzeo, Patrick Greaney, and Simon Leung. The second event, "What Matters," took place on May 9, 2012 and featured Michael du Plessis, Brian Teare, and Lincoln Tobier. The final event, "Authentic Objects," took place on June 13, 2012 and featured Judie Bamber, [Dodie Bellamy](Bellamy.php), and Terry Castle. All of the events took place at the MAK Center for Art and Architecture in Los Angeles, CA and were moderated by [Vanessa Place](Place.php). The series was curated by Les Figues Press and supported by a Cultural Resource Development Grant from the City of West Hollywood.
