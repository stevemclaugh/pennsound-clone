Régis Bonvicino  
Régis and I were riding
through the outskirts of São Paulo on our way to Campinas.The
World Cup was on and Régis shares
Brazil's big-time enthrallment with the series. At one point,
in an email, Régis reprimanded me for referring to the "Australia
and Brazil game." "In
Brazil, you never write the 'Brazil - Australia game', but 'Brazil
x Australia'. The x meaning the match, the 'hardness' of the
game .... It sounds like a battle, for us, not like
a game." Régis told
me he was devoted to a local football team and went to almost
all their games."My team's name
is Palmeiras (Palms), founded in 1914 by Italian immigrants
to keep alive Italian traditions in São Paulo." I
asked him how the team was doing.

**George Lakoff**  
George came to visit Susan Bee and me on the Fourth of July.
He was in town to promote his new book, *Whose
Freedom?: The Battle Over America's Most Important Ideal.* I
asked
him why John Kerry had failed to respond forcefully to the Swift
Boat smears. You can hear Susan in the background.

Leslie Scalapino  
Leslie was in New York for
the Poetry Project panels on her work. She came by our place
for lox & bagels. I asked her about the time she literally
lost her breath in Tibet.

**Mimi Gross**  
Mimi believes the key thing about doing portraits is the
relationship you have with the subject. A couple of years ago,
she did a [portrait
of Felix and me](http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/my-pictures/CB/Charles-Felix-by-Mimi.GIF). We were at Herring Cove beach and Mimi,
as always, had brought a sketchbook. Talking to Mimi gave me
the idea to do these portraits. **

Loss Peqeuño Glazier  
I was back in Buffalo and at
one my favorite spots, Ted's Red Hots (the one on Niagara Falls
Boulevard). We got to talking about Cuba, which we had visited,
together with  Ernesto Livon-Grosman, Johanna Drucker, and
Brad Freeman, in January 2003. Loss met his future wife on that
trip. I asked him what
he liked to eat in Havana.

Caroline Bergvall  
In June, 2005, I was invited to read at poetry festival
in Norway. I couldn't go, but I urged the organizers to invite
Caroline, who grew up, at least partly, in Norway, but nobody
there (at least among the poets I know) were aware of that. But
they sure are now.
