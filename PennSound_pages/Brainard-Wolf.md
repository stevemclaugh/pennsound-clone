Modesty, whimsy, and clarity of design grace the work of [Joe Brainard](http://www.joebrainard.org/) (1941-1994), an artist and writer whose evocations of memory and desire perhaps found their greatest expression in his memoir-poem *I Remember*. Composed of a sequence of brief recollections, the poem's standardized format admits an incredible variety of images and feelings: "I remember Greyhound buses at night...I remember candy cigarettes like chalk...I remember leaning up against walls in queer bars..." Brainard's many drawings, collages, assemblages, and paintings, as well as his short essays and verbal-visual collaborations were celebrated during his lifetime before he stopped making art in the mid-1980s.  
  
Filmmaker Matt Wolf returns to this iconic poem in his film *I Remember: A Film About Joe Brainard*. His archival montage combines audio recordings of Brainard reading from the poem, as well as an interview with his lifelong friend and collaborator, the poet [Ron Padgett](http://www.ronpadgett.com/). The result is an inventive biography of Joe Brainard, and an elliptical dialog about friendship, nostalgia, and the strange wonders of memory.
