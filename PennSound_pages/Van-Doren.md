was also affiliated with the production the series. These digitizations are made from reel-to-reel dubs of the aluminum records, made by the Library of Congress in 1978. For more information on this series of recordings, see [Mustazza on *The Contemporary Poets Series*](https://jacket2.org/article/provenance-report) in *Jacket2*.
