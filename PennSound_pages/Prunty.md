a fever is a warning
--------------------

This poem was written over a two-year period using a doubling method.
The final product is 2048 lines.
The previous drafts were lines of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024.
Each iteration was written by double-spacing the previous version, writing "lines that fit"
in the spaces, and adding a line at the end. The poem was performed June 9, 2009
at PushPush Theater in Decatur Georgia. Randy Prunty, Megan Volpert, and Bruce Covey
took turns reading the main text. Stephanie Paulk and Mindy Friedman
took turns reading any text in parentheses or brackets. The text was projected onto a large
screen during the reading so the audience could read along during the performance.
