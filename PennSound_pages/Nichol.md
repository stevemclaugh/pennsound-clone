**5.**  
The following are all of the poems from the 60-minute cassette *Ear Rational: Sound Poems 1966-1980*, published in 1982 by Membrane Press New Fire Tapes (Milwaukee). Note that beside each poem-title is the year in which Nichol composed the piece. Making brief appearances are the voices of Michael Dean, Paul Dutton, Steve McCaffery, David Penhale, Steven Smith (now Steven Ross Smith), and Richard Truhlar (see jwcurry’s “Notes toward a beepliography,” *Open Letter* 6 th series, No. 5-6: Summer-Fall 1986: 249-270.) Nichol also included a brief statement inside the 5-panel offset lead for the cassette:

“Dada Lama” was recorded at CBC Studios (Toronto) circa 1969. “The Alphabet Game” was recorded at CBC Studios (Toronto) circa 1972. “Acres Rare Meet” was recorded live in Toronto, October 1977. All others were recorded at the studios of T.R.G. January 10, 1982.

“Cosmic Piece for Orchestra & Chorus” is performed by Steve McCaffery (voice & vocorder) & bpNichol (voice & cheap cassette). “Acres Rare Meet” is performed by Michael Dean, Paul Dutton, Steve McCaffery, David Penhale, Steven Smith & Richard Truhlar. The woman's voice on “The Alphabet Game” is that of a friend of the producer who, unfortunately, i have lost all record of. All other voices are my own.  
  
*Ear Rational* contains all the single voice pieces i composed
in the years 1970 thru 1980 other than sections of *The Martyrology
Bk V* & a part of the May Day Book. In addition i have included:
a live recording of the only seven voice piece i've done, “Acres
Rare Meet”; an alternate version of “Dada Lama,” previously
unreleased; the first adequate realization of my composition “Cosmic
Piece for Orchestra & Chorus”; & the only remaining unrecorded
single voice text from the 60's – “Ballads Of The Restless
Are.” In the seventies i put the bulk of my energy in sound into
composing for & with the Four Horsemen. In the single voice pieces
the interest began to shift toward the more narrative & prose-based
concerns evident in the most recent compositions on this tape, “Interrupted
Nap” & “Art in Upheaval.” This cassette is dedicated
to Steve McCaffery, my partner in the Crimes in both the Toronto Research
Group & the Four Horsemen.
