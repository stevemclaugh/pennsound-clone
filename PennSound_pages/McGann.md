**Author's note on the work**  
I became seriously interested in the dialogue as a “form
of critical discourse” around 1970, when I wrote the first – and
longest – of
my critical dialogues, *Swinburne. An Experiment in Criticism*.
It seemed to me – and still seems – a useful method
for investigating a subject when uncertainties and contradictions
pervade your field of interest. The dialogue form allows you
to expose and play out those uncertainties and contradictions.
The form also encourages one to seek out lines of thought that
the traditional critical essay, with its commitment to argument
and exposition, discourages.

Later I learned – from Lucan and Wilde – that one could sharpen
the critical edge by running a ludic strain through the dialogic exchanges.
Comic interventions turned out particularly useful for critical enlightenment
if the dialogue was consciously turned upon its author (i.e., myself), producing
what Arnold disparaged as a “dialogue of the mind with itself.”
Arnold had a somewhat undeveloped sense of humor.

The “Dialogue on Dialogue” given here was the first of two whose specific aim was to investigate the nature of dialogue itself. The other was the last sustained dialogue I wrote, "The Alice Fallacy; or, Only God Can Make a Tree. A Dialogue of Pleasure and Instruction" (1997). These are the only two of my dialogues that have actually been performed. “The Alice Fallacy” was given dramatic readings at University of Virginia and Stanford University in 1997, and in 1998 it was performed as a play at University of North Carolina.

Several of my recent books and essays break into unannounced dialogical moments, like unruly Printer’s Devils or Footnotes. These are usually brief events, but in a few cases the dialogical interludes are more extensive. In any case, the following is a list of the completely dialogical works, all of which – except for the Swinburne book -- were written between 1987 and 1996.
