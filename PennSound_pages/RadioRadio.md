**R A D I O     R A D I O**  
  
RADIO RADIO is a sixteen-part series of forty-five minute broadcasts  
which asks an honest question: Is there really a place on radio for  
experimentation? Twenty people immersed in radio, sound and  
performance (Prix Italia winners, Prix Futura winners, SONY winners  
and platinum recording artists as well as sound poets, unconventional  
radio producers, audio artists, critically savvy DJs and writers on  
the social and aesthetic margins) offer, in their own ways, answers  
to this question through conversation and the presentation of their  
work. Things called "voice bumpers" frame and counterpoint larger  
discussions throughout the series. Ironic versions of the music  
bumpers in NPR-style magazine programs, these voice bumpers combine  
found sound with conversation fragments from interviews with  
important radio critics, scholars and inventive practitioners (Allen  
Weiss, Kersten Glandien, Kenneth Goldsmith, Lauren Goodlad, Mark  
Percival, Himan Brown, Tim Crook, Matthew Finch, David Chesworth,  
Sonia Leber, Simon Elmes and Jo Tacchi) to create a listening  
experience more restless and engaging than it is wallpaper.  
  
Radio Radio evolves out of two other recent projects: a  
BBC-broadcast, radio art magazine called *ENGAGED*, and a U.S.-based  
nationally-distributed literary series called LINEbreak. It combines  
the production style and innovative editing of *ENGAGED*, the in-depth  
interviewing and host presence of LINEbreak, and material with an  
international scope. The series debuted on 104.4 Resonance FM in  
London, England, in 2003 and will be heard on stations and networks  
around the world until 2005. The series was produced, researched and  
edited by Martin Spinelli.  
  
  
PROGRAM 1: GREGORY WHITEHEAD  
Gregory Whitehead has created remarkable sound for radio, the stage  
and the gallery for over twenty years. His more than one-hundred  
radio plays, essays and performances notably include Dead Letters,  
Pressures of the Unspeakable (winner of a Prix Italia) and Shake  
Rattle Roll (winner of a Prix Futura). He has written extensively on  
the unique qualities of "radio art" and co-edited the seminal radio  
criticism anthology *Wireless Imagination*.

PROGRAM 2: STEPHEN ERICKSON  
Stephen Erickson has produced perhaps the best documentaries heard on  
radio in the past twenty-five years and garnered numerous awards in  
the process (most significantly a Grammy for his audio work on Ken  
Burns's series The Civil War). His Radio Radio program features  
samples from his programs Forbidden Voyage, The Exile of Braten  
Braten Bach, Airworks and The Blue Wall of Silence: the New York  
Police Department.

PROGRAM 3: JENNIFER AND KEVIN MCCOY  
Jennifer & Kevin McCoy are Brooklyn-based artists who cycle, repeat and morph pop-culture tropes and images. Their series of microradio installations conflate gallery patrons with pirate radio listeners while ironically tweaking the language of novels like *Frankenstein, Alice in Wonderland* and the corporate-promo-speak of the web. In New York City their work has been exhibited at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, P.S.1, Postmasters Gallery, The New Museum and other venues.

PROGRAM 4: CRIS CHEEK  
cris cheek is a sound poet, performer, curator and SONY Award winner. He has collaborated on the Slant series of CDs and has created soundtracks (or languagetracks) for choreographers such as Michael Clarke, Kirstie Simpson, Miranda Tufnell, Lisa Nelson, Patricia Bardi, Mary Prestidge, Sue MacLennan and Julyen Hamilton. In his Radio Radio program cheek discusses "performance writing" and plays/performs "Public Announcement," "How Can this Hum Be Human" and other pieces.

PROGRAM 5: CHARLES BERNSTEIN  
Charles Bernstein is a poet, critic and formerly the David Gray Chair
of Poetry and Letters at SUNY Buffalo, now professor of poetry at
the University of Pennsylvania. He is Executive Director of the Electronic
Poetry Center and (perhaps most famously) he edited with Bruce
Andrews *The L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Book,* which gave rise to its own
genre of writing. On his Radio Radio program he performs selections
from his book *With Strings,* his opera *Shadowtime* about the life of
Walter Benjamin, and "Dear Mr. Fanelli."

PROGRAM 6: JOHN OSWALD  
John Oswald's 1989 CD *Plunderphonics* spawned a new category of music which samples not just pop songs, but their cultural contexts as well. Since then Oswald has refined his "electroquoting" on the CDs *Greyfolded, Electrax, Discosphere, Plexure* and the recently released *Plunderphonics* box set. In his Radio Radio program he talks about the legal machinations that have surrounded his work and plays a range of examples.

PROGRAM 7: BOB COBBING  
Bob Cobbing was a fixture on the London literary scene from the late 1940s until his death in 2002. Despite being the publisher of Writers Forum, having produced hundreds of books of poetry and pieces of visual art, and more-or-less inventing the concept of the "sound text," he made remarkably few inroads into either institutionalized art culture or academe. His Radio Radio program is his last broadcast interview.

PROGRAM 8: CHRISTOF MIGONE  
Christof Migone is a composer, performer and radio artist who heads the Centre for Radiotelecommunication Contortions (CRTC) where the voice of his radio body hems, haws, slurps, clicks, breaths, contorts, cuts, modulates and masticates. His CDs include *South Winds, Undo* and *Radio Folie/Culture*. On Radio Radio he plays selections from his other CDs *Hole in the Head*, *Vex* and *The Death of Analogies*.  
*<img src="favicon.png" width="16" height="16" />* [MP3 (45:00)](http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/groups/radioradio/08_Christof-Migone_Radio-Radio_NY_2003.mp3)

PROGRAM 9: [MICHAEL BASINSKI](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Basinski.php)  
Michael Basinski sounds the poetry in "chart junk," the printers' ding-bats, wing-dings and odd typefaces found in any casual scroll through your word processor's font list. For more than twenty years he has performed choral voice collages and sound texts with his intermedia performance ensemble The Ebma; The Ebma has released two LPs: SEA and Enjambment.

PROGRAM 10: SIANED JONES & CRIS CHEEK  
Sianed Jones & cris cheek are poets, musicians and multi-media artists who have collaborated on the Slant series of CDs and performances. For Radio Radio they present and discuss several versions of their book/CD/performance project *Navigations

PROGRAM 12: PAUL D. MILLER, a.k.a. DJ SPOOKY  
Paul D. Miller, A.K.A. DJ Spooky, is a writer, visual artist and platinum-selling recording artist. His mixes blend black radio and cartoon soundtracks with vintage recordings of Thomas Edison and manage a rare combination of street credibility and critical sensibility. In his program he discusses "the mix" as culture and as metaphor.
