*"Lurking crime and lingering desire change the atmosphere of this brief but affecting film.
The light changes moment by moment. The season is shifting. Figures move like phantoms in the penumbra.
Beethoven glowers against the evening; a perfect Alice polishes bronze with her petticoat; traffic in diamonds and rubies
twines its way among the trees; snarling youths self-destruct. The false promises of youth, beauty and art are the smoke out
the windows of fire along Fifth Avenue."*  
-- Christopher Sweet
