***MIRROR WORLD*** (2006)

(12 min, sound, color.)

*In collaboration with Gary Sullivan and Mehboob Khan's AAN*

A reshaping of Mehboob Khan's classic Bollywood feature AAN into a comic
and disturbing study of class and sexuality. Formal play and poetic
subtitles deconstruct the narrative to locate the sub-version: the
princess becomes the maid, the maid becomes queen. *MIRROR WORLD* wrenches
narrative causality, and discovers with digital printing, ways to wreck
havoc on our perceptions of the world. Hypnotic and beautiful: you
cannot turn away.

Conceived, directed and edited by Abigail Child

"Abigail Child's series IS THIS WHAT YOU WERE BORN FOR? is one of the
most assured and important projects to have emerged over the last
decade. Constructing from and subverting a wide galaxy of source
materials, these films are archeological digs into the very stuff, the
conceptions, we are born into. Child decomposes the materials and
gestures that would compose us. The films are charged with a startling
and playful musicality and poetic and rigorous compression. Each image
and sound cuts deep and works over time containing hidden and unhidden
detonations working against the manufactured ambush that images have in
store. Agile dances through treacherous debris, they negotiate an
obstacle course of polar anatomies zig-zagging with corkscrew twists and
nuclear splits -- a gambol against the hazards.

Detournments, deviations, disruptions, allures. Can aggression be
sumptuous? These films are volatile and they have bite. Here the
subliminal cannot caress, it comes out with its hands up, the smile
wiped from its face. The accelerated velocity of these films doesn't
create an alternate camouflage. At this speed viewer passivity is unsafe
and active viewing is a necessary pleasure. We are provoked to get up to
speed, to be resourceful, dance, break step. These films put a spin on
things. Shift the coordinates. The peripheries relocate to the core
drawn by the centrifugal force of the editing. Posing a threat to
threatening poses these frictions erupt with new clarity."
