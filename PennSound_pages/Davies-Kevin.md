Reading in the BBR Reading Series: Curated by Africa Wayne; Bar Reis; Brooklyn, NY; Tuesday, June 8, 2004
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Davies reads from an early version of a long poem in short (untitled) sections called "Excerpts from an Ongoing Narrative of Some Length." Part of the work is forthcoming in the next issue of The Poker, out of Cambridge, MA. Ultimately, the whole (edited) piece will be part of The Golden Age of Paraphernalia, to be published by Edge books in Washington in the spring of 2006.
