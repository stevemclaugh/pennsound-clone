### Sound Poetry Videos, 1995-2008

1. **Minna No Uta (Song for Everyone), 1995**

A performance by turntable player and publicly gathered unprofessional voice performers (around 10). A sound signal is sent from the turntable player to headphones which all voice performers wear. These performers imitate the sound without any interpretation; the performers play exactly the role of amplifiers and speakers. All performer's voices and acts are totally different because input sounds are too complex to imitate accurately. The audience cannot hear original turntable sounds.

  

2. **Adachi Tomomi Royal Chorus performing Yoiko, 1999**

  

3. **Performance for Voice and Infrared Sensor Shirt, 2004-2006**

  

4. **Osuterokomusa, 2006**

Basic elements are composed by complicated canonic methods for a text (poly-linguistic; alphabet based and Japanese syllable letter based). It is an exploration in polyphony from a monophonic text.

  

5. **Sound Poetry in a Bath, 2007**

A performance based on the first published sound poetry in Japan; "Voice Sound Poetry Form Begun With -X-" written by futurist painter Hide Kinoshita in 1924. The poem was printed on Japanese Dadaism magazine "MAVO."  

  

6. **Yumiko, 1997/2008**

  

7. **Performance with dj sniff at Super Deluxe, Roppongi, March 29, 2008**
