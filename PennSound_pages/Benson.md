The first set includes a number of pieces, some with prepared audio back-up on cassette tape, half on them including improvised material. The
second presents one continuous work. For this set, Steve Benson sat at a table facing the back wall, where Super8 rolls and 35mm slides he had
shot over the previous 20 years were projected very large, while he used notes he had brought on scraps of paper, the images
in the video, and associations that occured to him at the time to improvise orally. This piece is documented in *Blue Book* under the title of "Voice-overs."
