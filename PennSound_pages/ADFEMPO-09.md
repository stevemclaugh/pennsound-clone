4:00PM-5:00PM  
**Opening Plenary I: Why You Talk Like That? Between Orature and Literature**  
Chair: [Tonya Foster](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Foster.php)  
Panelists: Meta DuEwa Jones, John Keene, [Julie Patton](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Patton.html), [Evie Shockley](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Shockley.php)  
Location: English Department Lounge  

Description: One aspect of “black aesthetics” involves two ostensibly dissonant strands of poetics the oral and the literary (which may include the visual).
Their challenging of visual and oral groundings of identity markers translates Black female iconography from its historical depiction within a “So Black and Blues” matrix into
a “So Black and Beautiful”. One aspect of “black aesthetics” isn’t merely the transcription of the oral onto the page but an attempt to transfigure the page in such a way that
it creates/suggests an alternate space which demands that the literary engage the oral, re-inscribes the literary nature of the oral and rejects the clearly articulated boundary
between the two, and, in so doing, suggests a different sense of time: look at Mackey and Brathwaite’s A History of the Voice.

**Opening Plenary II: Wedge & Suture: Critical Language Practices & the Imperialist Event**  
Chair: [Laura Elrick](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Elrick.php)  
Panelists: [Ammiel Alcalay](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Alcalay.php), Cathy Park Hong, [Anne Waldman](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Waldman.php), [Rachel Zolf](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Zolf.php)  
Location: English Department Lounge  

Description: On the “here and now” continuum, on the radically material cusp that articulates past and future, what methods of political thought can poetry
uniquely perform? How can poetry (as radical anathema to imperialist language use, and as intellectual hope) resist the dead-end traps of reification and teleological
thinking? Our discussion will center on the complexities and difficulties (and therefore importance) of radical language practices within our unevenly-developed but
globalized relations.

10:00AM-11:45AM — SESSION I  
  
Room 1 \[Panel 1\]: **Is Ground as to Figure as Ambience is to Body? Ec(h)opoetics of the Disfigured Landscape**  
Chair: Jennifer Scappettone  
Panelists: Marcella Durand, Brenda Iijima, Linda Sormin, Kathy Westwater, Rita Wong  

Description: Ranging across writing, visual arts, dance, installation, and epistolary exchange of ephemera, this discussion will sound reciprocal interference between the
environment and marked (raced/gendered/polluted) corporeality in the face of landscape’s harm—mediation—digitization—withdrawal. Presentations will address a poetics of
systemic crisis, stalking solutions, obliging recognition of ambient relations of authority and compromise as compass through a stupefying enormity of damage: Marcella Durand
on race and ecological disaster; Brenda Iijima on Agnes Denes’s reclamation art; Kathy Westwater on bodily organization within transmogrifying ‘nature’; Rita Wong and Linda Sormin
on ongoing toxicities.

  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Room 2 \[Panel 2\]: **Lacrimae of the Medusa; or, Cixous (33 years later) and Cruci-Fictions: Let’s Talk about Sex (Again)**  
Chair: [Laura Jaramillo](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Jaramillo.php)  
Panelists: [Dodie Bellamy](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Bellamy.php), Kass Fleisher, [Bhanu Kapil](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Kapil.html), Laura Mullen  

Description: This panel will explore how womens' experimental writing re-inscribes female subjectivity and desire, how we ride the boundaries, borders, inter-species-genre
crossings, body spaces through Cixous' Laugh of the Medusa.

Room 3 \[Panel 3\]: **Textual Migrations: Language, Media, Space**  
Chair: Corey Frost  
Panelists: Caroline Bergvall, Latasha N. Nevada Diggs, Majena Mafe, Mendi Lewis Obadike, Kaia Sand  

Description: As writers and readers, we are all affected by the multimedia functioning of communication technologies, their presence it our daily activities. As the concept of
literacy changes, our understanding of poetics and our perceptions of identity also change. What does the specific role of language and of writing become? Should we envisage
tomorrow's literature as a relay of processes, a combination of forms, of platforms, of environments, of media as well as discourses? What is the textual specifically in charge
of recording, transmitting, transmediating? This panel invites 4 writers to present some of the methods and questions they explore when working with specific media and performative
environments.

  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Room 4 \[Panel 4\]: **Conceptual Writings**  
Chair: Mónica de la Torrev
Panelists: Nada Gordon, Vanessa Place, Sina Queyras, Kim Rosenfield, Christine Wertheim  

Description: Conceptual writing, still under construction as a 21st century literary form, includes various kinds of work and techniques, such as appropriation, documentation,
constraint, process, performance, polyvocality, collapsing search engines and the baroque. Panelists Mónica de la Torre, Nada Gordon, Sina Queyras, Kim Rosenfield, Christine Wertheim,
and Vanessa Place will present/perform/comment on critical/creative work on conceptualism.

  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Room 5 \[Panel 5\]: **8 Minute Monographs, Part 1**  
Chair: Susan Briante  

Panelists: David Buuck, CAConrad, Tom Orange, Rodrigo Toscano, Simone White  
Description: David Buuck on “Bioperversity: on the gendered animal-body”; CAConrad will give a talk entitled “A Poetry of No Apologies” about Hilde Domin and Charlotte Delbo;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Room 6 \[Panel 6\]: **The Event in the Image: Poetry and Cinema**  
Curated by: Angela Joosse  
Films and poetry by: Peggy Ahwesh, Lise Beaudry, Abigail Child, Margaret Christakos, Moyra Davey, Kelly Egan, Laura Elrick, Su Friedrich, Amy Greenfield, Shana MacDonald,
Bridget Meeds, Izabella Pruska-Oldenhof, Selene Savarie, Joel Schlemowitz, Nathalie Stephens, Souvankham Thammavongsa,Gariné Torossian, Cat Tyc  

Description: This program of recent experimental film and video examines the productive impact to be found at the intersection of feminism, poetry, and the moving image.
Sharing common concerns with rhythm, duration, and the slippage and condensation of meaning, experimental cinema and poetry have had rich relations since cinema's inception.
Yet the avant-garde edge of these art forms does not rest with medium-specific concerns, but rather with the capacity to install the audience in a situation that enables a
potent shift in one's very perceptions of embodied, social, geographical, gendered, political, and cultural locatedness in the world. Through poetic approaches to cinema and
cinematic approaches to poetry, this program explores varying possibilities of the image as an event situation.

  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
12:45PM-2:30PM SESSION II  
  
Room 1 \[Panel 7\]: **What Counts: Everyday Practices and Exceptional Practices in the Life of the Mind and in the Street**  
Chair: Jen Hofer  
Panelists: Pamela Booker, Marilou Esguerra, Jill Magi, Metta Sama  

Description: The politics of the everyday entails inventing exceptions to the rules in a range of contexts, from our bedrooms, kitchens, studies and gardens to our jobs,
gathering spaces, and the streets of the cities where we live. The participants in this panel are all on the faculty at Goddard College, where a radical social justice pedagogy
encompassing Thoughtful Action is a foundation of our teaching, learning and artistic practices. How do small-scale autonomous publishing, politically-inflected performance,
objects and texts built to be functional as well as thought-provoking, public instances of poetic interaction and other externally-directed creative acts constitute Thoughtful
Action—that is, how do we practice what we teach, and teach what we practice?

  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Room 2 \[Panel 8\]: **Body as Discourse**  
Chair: Kate Eichhorn  
Panelists: [Joan Retallack](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Retallack.php), Trish Salah, Laura Smith, Nathalie Stephens (Nathanaël), Ronaldo V. Wilson  

Description: This panel explores questions of the body, referentiality, remapping bodies and borders, intertextuality, narrativity, aesthetics, and the challenges of
de-essentialization as we scrutinize “female,” “queer,” “raced” and “othered” bodies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Room 3 \[Panel 9\]: **Multilingual Poetics, Feminist Implications**  
Chair: Sarah Dowling  
Panelists: Julia Bloch, Angela Carr, Zhang Er, Sueyeun Juliette Lee, Janet Neigh  

Description: This panel will explore the ways women poets use multilingualism to engage in critiques of dominant language practices, and the ways in which such poetics evoke
diverse publics and invite new possibilities for building community.

  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Room 4 \[Panel 10\]: **Disrupting the Page: Hybridity and Asian American Poetics**  
Chair: Tamiko Beyer  
Panelists: Cythia Arrieu-King, Ching-In Chen, Sarah Gambito, Sohan Patel, Margaret Rhee  

Description: This roundtable discussion by a group of emerging APIA women poets/critics/performers will open up discussion about how hybridities in current APIA poetry
resist the notion of a homogenous feminist and APIA poetry and community. Speakers will address a range of contemporary formal and social concerns: mapping, the cyber avatar,
queer, experimental and lyric poetry, “deterriorialized” writing, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's video poems, traditional Japanese zuihitsu. The goal is to provide a collaborative space
in which to investigate the avant-garde poetic strategies of APIA women who write for social justice and against inequalities.

  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Room 5 \[Panel 11\]: **8 Minute Monographs, Part II: Inhabiting the Forms of An/Other**  
Chair: Emily Beall  
Panelists: Louis Bury, Jeanne Heuving, Michelle Naka Pierce, Tim Peterson, Chris Tysh  

Description: Each monographer will take up questions of form, form’s body, and how form can generate (instead of delimit) substantive, complex, productively unstable
embodiments and identities. Tracing possibilities such as the “libidinized open field,” Oulipian exercises in style, Deleuzian sheets of time, the protean and the nomadic,
panelists might themselves swerve importantly from the ‘monadic’ form of the monograph: Michelle Naka Pierce, “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Migratory Identities in Bhanu Kapil’s
Incubation: A Space for Monsters” / Jeanne Heuving, “What's Love Got To Do With It?” / Tim Peterson, “Protean Bodies, Volatile Selves: The Transgender Poetics of Claude Cahun
and kari edwards” / Chris Tysh, “Sheets of Time in Poetic Practice” / Louis Bury, “Embodied Constraints.”

  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Room 6 \[Panel 12\]: **The Event in the Image: Poetry and Cinema**  
Curated by: Angela Joosse  
Films and poetry by: Peggy Ahwesh, Lise Beaudry, Abigail Child, Margaret Christakos, Moyra Davey, Kelly Egan, Laura Elrick, Su Friedrich, Amy Greenfield, Shana MacDonald, Bridget Meeds,
Izabella Pruska-Oldenhof, Selene Savarie, Joel Schlemowitz, Nathalie Stephens, Souvankham Thammavongsa,Gariné Torossian, Cat Tyc  

Description: This program of recent experimental film and video examines the productive impact to be found at the intersection of feminism, poetry, and the moving image. Sharing
common concerns with rhythm, duration, and the slippage and condensation of meaning, experimental cinema and poetry have had rich relations since cinema's inception. Yet the
avant-garde edge of these art forms does not rest with medium-specific concerns, but rather with the capacity to install the audience in a situation that enables a potent shift in
one's very perceptions of embodied, social, geographical, gendered, political, and cultural locatedness in the world. Through poetic approaches to cinema and cinematic approaches to
poetry, this program explores varying possibilities of the image as an event situation.

  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
2:30PM-4:00PM SESSION III  
  
Room 1 \[Panel 13\]: **Writing from the Margins**  
Chair: erica kaufman  
Panelists: Jennifer Russo, Tyler Schmidt, Jane Sprague  

Description: This panel will explore the feminist politics and poetic experimentation of poets from earlier generations in order to better understand (and complicate) the
activism and avant-garde aesthetics of our current moment. Collectively our papers aim to investigate the work of marginal, forgotten, erased, absent or orphan/overlooked poets
and writers whose poetics embody a kind of “activism,” though our panel also seeks to trouble or assert ideas of activist poetics. In particular, our critical analysis will highlight
the way these poets both engage and enact political critique through formal innovation; avant-garde writing strategies; polyvocal texts; and/or hybrid forms and genres.

  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Room 2 \[Panel 14\]: **Feminist Utopias**  
Chair: Margaret Carson  
Panelists: Justin Parks, Divya Victor, danielle vogel, Steve Zultanski  

Description: This panel will be exploring the possibility of a Utopian promise in contemporary poetry. We will be looking at the work of Renee Gladman, Lisa Robertson,
Melissa Buzzeo, and Jewel in an effort to explore these authors' formal and political relationships to urban space, and to their readers. We don’t assume these writers share a
vision, but rather that their poetics and poetry are in some ways at odds — suggesting that any recognizable Utopian impulse is not a fully-realized imaginative portrait of a
better world, but a fractured and incomplete projection of a time yet to come.

  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Room 3 \[Panel 15\]: **Exile and Language**  
Chair: Anna Moschovakis  
Panelists: Jennifer Firestone, Dana Greene, Dulcinea Lara, Jill Magi, Evelyn Reilly  

Description: What are the challenges facing a writer who for one reason or another finds herself “exiled” from the generative artistic and cultural communities that sustain much
of a writer’s activities? This panel brings together the diverse concerns of writers thinking from spaces of remove: motherhood amidst the event-heavy poetry community; activist
pedagogy in small-town America; experimental poetics in workers’ education; and a genealogy and performance of Vulcan Poetics.

  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Room 4 \[Panel 16\]: **Visuality and the Image: A Reading and Discussion with Ann Lauterbach, Mei-mei Berssenbrugge and Laura Hinton**  
Chair: Laura Hinton  
Panelists: Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Ann Lauterbach  

Description: This session takes the form of readings by and conversation with Mei-mei Berssenbrugge, Ann Lauterbach, and Laura Hinton. Framed as a performative inquiry into women’s
particular use of the image, both in feminist and activist contexts, we'll consider the stakes in image-making for a gender that Mary Ann Doane has suggested bears a socialized “close
proximity” to the image itself.

  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Room 5 \[Panel 17\]: **Speed Youth Mourning**  
Chair: [Rachel Levitsky](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Levitsky.php)  
Panelists: Emily Abendroth, [Tonya Foster](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Foster.php), Kythe Heller, [Kristin Prevallet](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Prevallet.html), [Michelle Taransky](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Taransky.php), [Jennifer Scappettone](http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Scappettone.php)  

Description: The presenters, mixing performance, conversation and reading, will consider how the expansion of the prison, disaster capitalism, and the vertigo of speed culture
implode the ambit of community. Can we as writers and actors-in-concert re-imagine the contours and relieved duration of a 'commons' in which we dwell despite our increased
mobility, that is sustainable within our current spatiotemporal condition? Are there new opportunities for meaning, mutual succor, and collective action across identity/location/generation
in these “liquid times”?

Description: Poets Hoa Nguyen, Christine Hume, Laynie Browne, Lee Ann Brown, and Leah Souffrant will present their work as performance, followed by a round-table discussion of
the work and the significance of the intersection of motherhood, performance, and poetics. Christine Hume will perform “Lullaby: Speculations on the First Active Sense”, an
essay-poem with a soundtrack. Laynie Browne reads from The Desires of Letters, a long prose-poetry work. Lee Ann Brown will perform new and signature poetic works relating to the
subject of motherhood. Hoa Nguyen will read new works and from Hecate Loche. Leah Souffrant will read from “Essay for Elsa”, a series accompanied by visual projections.
