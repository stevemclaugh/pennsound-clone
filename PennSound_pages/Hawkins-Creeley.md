**Robert Creeley and Company: home movies by Bobbie Louise Hawkins**

*Bobbie Louise Hawkins took these home movies from 1962 to 1965. She provided them to Robert McTavish for his film about the Vancouver poetry conference of 1963, [The Line Has Shattered](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2013/06/the-line-has-shattered-new-documentary-explores-1963-vancouver-poetry-conference/) (2013) and then asked McTavish to send them to PennSound.  
Penelope Creeley, Ed Sanders, McTavish, and friends worked with me to provide the annotations. We welcome any further identifications: let us know!
