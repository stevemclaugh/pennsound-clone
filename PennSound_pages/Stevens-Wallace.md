1954 Readings at the Trans-Radio Recording Studio, Boston
---------------------------------------------------------

This recording was made at the Trans-Radio Recording Studio in Boston over the course of two recording
sessions,
the first on October 8, 1954; the second at a later but unknown date. The recording was made on two
reels divided as follows: reel 1, all poems, including "The Auroras of Autumn" parts 1-5; reel 2,
only "The Auroras of Autumn," parts 6-10. (Note: It is not certain that the division of poems recorded
at the two sessions coincides with the division of the two reels, which are housed
at the Woodberry Poetry Room.)
