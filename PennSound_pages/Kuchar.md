*I, of the Cyclops*, 2006
-------------------------

  
A poem is read and emotions are unleashed. A book is signed and pets pampered as this tour of talented talkers weaves its way through Provincetown and New Jersey (with aturbulent exit in Manhattan). Enjoy the leisurely portraits and view young and old as they chew the fat in cozy habitats. Featuring, among others, Charles Bernstein, Susan Bee, Mimi Gross, John Waters, and Robert Breer, and a soupçon of melodrama to stir things up.

*Coven of the Heathenites*, 2008
--------------------------------

"This remarkable sequence in George Kuchar’s 2008 video diary, *Coven of the Heathenites*, combines two visionary aesthetic strategies –– Felix Bernstein’s inspired reading of Ann Blyth’s 'With this money I can get away' rant in Mildred Pierce, and Kuchar's equally inspired decision to use it over spectacular footage of Provincetown’s Gay Pride parade. The hallucinatory result makes *Coven* one of Kuchar’s most memorable works.” – from *Tarnished Angel: The Diaries of George Kuchar* by Gene Youngblood, author of *Expanded Cinema*.
