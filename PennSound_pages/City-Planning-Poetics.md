City Planning Poetics
=====================

Organized and hosted by Davy Knittle, "City Planning Poetics" holds events once a semester at Kelly Writers House "that invite one or more poets
and one or more planners, designers, planning historians or others working in the field of city planning to discuss a particular
topic central to their work, to ask each other questions, and to read from their current projects."
