Reading at Rhinebeck, June 23, 2016
-----------------------------------

### A note on the readings at the Rhinebeck

During Spring 2016 Charles Stein and I decided to embark on a recording project together, which
blossomed into producing an elaborate multi-decade retrospective of his published poetry (as well as
some unpublished and improvised sound poems). We met regularly at my home studio between June
and September, recording more than eighteen hours of <span class="title">theforestforthetrees</span>
(an overarching name given to the body of his work), including a copious amount of material
from a series of books titled <span class="title">Views from Tornado Island</span> as well as
his collection <span class="title">The Hat Rack Tree</span> and <span class="title">From
Mimir's Head</span>. These readings are the first in a sequence of additions Stein and I
intend to add to PennSound's archive. Stay tuned!
