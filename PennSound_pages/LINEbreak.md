### The LINEbreak Programs

Winner of the 1997 CASE Award for Radio Programming, LINEbreak
is a series of half-hour length programs with some of the smartest and most
innovative writers and artists at work today. LINEbreak showcases a broad
range of authors from around the country and around the world, from famous
novelists and screenwriters whose work is regularly reviewed in *The New
York Times*, *The Village Voice,* and *The New York Review of Books*,
to revolutionary and avant-garde poets, performance artists and video artists
whose work is often neglected by the mainstream media. The series is hosted
and co-produced by poet and professor [Charles
Bernstein](http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/), and is produced and directed by [Martin
Spinelli](http://wings.buffalo.edu/epc/authors/spinelli/).

The LINEbreak series was distributed nationally to all connected public radio stations in the U.S. over the Public Radio Satellite System in the spring and summer of 1996, and has been heard on a number of public and college stations from New York to California.
