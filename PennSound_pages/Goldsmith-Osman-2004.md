> > The book seems to be about how we are all "assholes" in the way we talk
> > about
> > others.
> > Was Goldsmith shocked to find himself so effortlessly
> > trashing people?

> > **on Jena Osman's "Dropping Leaflets"**:  
> > Our discussion of Jena Osman's "Dropping Leaflets" began
> > with this question: "I wonder if in 'Dropping Leafets' you have a clearer sense
> > than Kenny just described for Soliloquy of a politics of
> > language?" It's the poet's job to fight against euphemisms.

> >
> > **on Kenny Goldsmith's *Day* and non-interventionist language**:  
> > This part of the discussion began with this
> > question: "Speaking of filters, how did you deal with the *New York
> > Times* in your book called *Day*?"
> > \[5:36 [MP3](http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/groups/GoldsmithOsman/Goldsmith-Osman_04_KWH_Upenn_12-10-04.mp3)\]
> >
> > **on Goldsmith's aesthetic as "N+0"**:  
> > After a question was posed about computer-generated texts, Nick Montfort
> > joined the conversation and proposed that Goldsmith's mode was a variation of "N+7,"
> > a procedure of substitution (with the seventh word found in a dictionary after
> > each original). Goldsmith was merely doing "N+0"--not non-intervention but
> > zero-degree substitution. Osman disagrees, proposing "N/Z."

> >
> > **on Jackson Mac Low (whose death occurred the day before
> > this gathering)**:  
> > Osman speaks first about Mac Low's consistency and change. Goldsmith
> > characterizes Mac Low's purity. This leads to a discussion of
> > ethical modernism
> > \[17:11 [MP3](http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/groups/GoldsmithOsman/Goldsmith-Osman_06_KWH_UPenn_12-10-04.mp3)\]
> >
> > **on actual everyday language**:  
> > We don't think enough about the way we actually speak. "Life is
> > so much more interesting than art. 'Reality TV' is so much
> > more interesting than sitcoms." Fiction is dead. Reality has really replaced
> > fiction. Goldsmith's new project is to retype the contents of the
> > September 11, 2001 issue of the *New York Times*.
