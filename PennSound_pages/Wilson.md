Peter Lamborn Wilson
====================

In the spring of 2015 [Chris Funkhouser](Funkhouser.php) traveled to the Woodstock, NY home of Peter Lamborn Wilson for a series of nine recording sessions.
The results of those efforts — split into twenty sets in total — can be found below. Start times for individual poems within each set can be found
in curly brackets, while page numbers corresponding to [this 2014 collection of Wilson's unpublished poems](https://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Wilson/PLW-2015/Peter-Lamborn-Wilson_unpublished-poems_2014.pdf)
are found in square brackets. Listeners will want to consult Funkhouser's notes on his recordings, ["Peter Lamborn Wilson: A PennSound Archive,"](http://jacket2.org/article/peter-lamborn-wilson-pennsound-archive) published at *Jacket2*.  
  
You can use the links below to navigate to individual sessions:
