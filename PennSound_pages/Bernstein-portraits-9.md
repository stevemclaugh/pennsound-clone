[**Antin in the Sky with Diamonds  
("I do the best I can")**]()

**David Antin**  
David and I met for lunch in SoH0, near Ellie's gallery. Much of our conversation focussed on David's essay collection; there were enough works for two books, so which to leave out? David was never much interested in talking about collecting his essays; his focus was always on what he doing now, what he was doing next. That's partly why it took him so long to gather together the pieces in that book. But I was persistent and brought up the essay collection just about every time we met. After a while, we walked outside and wound our way, slowly, toward Houston, talking all the while. I asked David about his sky-writing poems.

**Ted Greenwald**  
In the 1970s Ted and I would meet in the afternoons and talk til night. We even did a recording of a couple of dozen hours of our conversations. I owe a tremendous amount to those meetings and to our many conversations since. On this particular afternoon we talked at the bar in the back of the restaurant (I can't remember the name of the place, but it was downtown).

**Ron Silliman  
**After a PoemTalk recording
at CPCW, Rachel, Ron, and I wondered over to a Thai place a few
blocks West on Chestnut. We then walked back to Walnut and 38th
and stopped for a minute on parking ramp, before getting in Ron's
car so he could drive Rachel home and drop me off at Bob and
Francie's.
