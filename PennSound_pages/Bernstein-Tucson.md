¶"[Work
In Progress](http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/blog/archive/progress.html)" (for Eliot Spitzer)  
¶ [Oshamnu](http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/poems/oshamnu.html) (from "A
Person Is Not an Entity Symbolic but the  Divine Incarnate" in *The
Sophist*) (a source for "Recantorium").

"Bachelor machine" \[*machines célibataires*\] comes from Duchamp's "Bride
Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even" (the lower part of
the "Large Glass,"
e.g., "Chocolate Grinder"). Michel Carrouges (in his book *Machines célibataires* \[Paris: Arcanes, 1954, 2nd ed. 1976\] extended
the term to incorporate the disciplinary apparatus of Kafka's *The
Penal Colony* &
also to Roussel's *Impressions
of Africa*, and some of Poe's machines as well, and, crucially, to the work of Alfred Jarry. This formulation has been [adapted by Deleuze and Guattari in *Anti-Oedipus*](http://books.google.com/books?id=WvvQfxvGfpYC&lpg=PA19&ots=3iV0Aee3P3&dq=Deleuze%20forms%20a%20new%20alliance%20between%20desiring%20machines%20and%20the%20body%20without%20organs%20to%20give%20birth%20to%20a%20new%20humanity&pg=PA19#v=onepage&q=&f=false) and also by [Michel de Certeau in *Ars de Faire*](http://books.google.com/books?id=WVn1XMEO168C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA150#v=onepage&q=&f=false)*..* As a term for poetic constructions, "bachelor machine" suggests
nonproductive, nonprocreative, onanistic processes, vicious
(or self-enclosing/collapsing) circles, an apparatus that is
unable to get outside itself. There is a connection, in my
use, to *délire* (delirium,
with special reference to Jean-Jacques LeCercle) — that
which goes astray, deviates from the rational, errs, raves. Though perhaps it would be better to call these works of mine anti-bachelor-machines.
